# Scandiweb Test Assignment

A small CRUD application (without U for now) to add/delete products.  

The Front End is fully written in React and is hosted on Netlify.  
The Back End is Node.js and is running on Heroku.
For database, I've got PostgresQL from Heroku as well.

P.S.: The database will most likely do a cold boot when you follow the link so give it a second.
